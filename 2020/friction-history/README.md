# friction-history
Code, models, assets, scripts, etc. used for the paper in which we compute the friction force by tracing the history of the contact points on the two bodies in contact.

Single sphere simulations are implemented in Matlab, code available in slide-roll-spin folder.

The 3-sphere stacking simulation is generated using a physics-based simulation engine, Chrono, available in: https://github.com/uwsbel/chrono-dev/, branch: sandbox/track-history

The demo is located in src/demos/parallel/demo_balls_stack.cpp
