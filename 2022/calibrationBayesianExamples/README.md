# metadata, Bayesian inference demonstration 

This metadata is tied to showing how Bayesian inference can be used in multibody dynamics.
There are two sets of metadata
- Bundle A - related to calibrating SCM to look like a proxy to SPH insofar terramechanics is concerned
- Bundle B - related to calibrating an 8DOF vehicle model to make it behave like a HMMWV model

Both the terramechanics and the reduced order vehicle dynamics model use the same Chrono::Vehicle HMMWV model.
