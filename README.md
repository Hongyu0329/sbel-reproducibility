# publications-data
models, data, information needed to generate results we publish in papers, tech reports, proposals, etc.

This repo contains data organized by year of when the manuscript was generated.

Each time we finish a manuscript that is public, the models, data, assets, etc. that were used to generate the manuscript should be deposited here for folks from outside the lab to be able to reproduce our results.
In an ideal world, for a manuscript, we would only provide a git commit ID for chrono, or a git commit ID model in chrono_project repo, etc. This would be dropped in a readme.md/txt file, with possible links to Box in case we have movies, pics, etc.
However, if providing a commit ID is not applicable, or more code, data, assets are needed - this is where it belongs.
