# The "public-metadata" repo
The repo contains assets, obj files, json files, scripts, Chrono models, etc., needed to generate results SBEL members report in papers, tech reports, presentations, etc.
This repo is organized by year of when the metadata was first added to the repo.

## Info for SBEL members
- Subfolders are meant to contain information associated with a paper, tech report, presentation, etc. 
- Please include a readme.md file in each subfolder to describe the content of the directroy along with where the material was used (which paper/tech report/etc.).
- If the data is meant to be used in conjunction with Chrono, please provide a commit ID/SHA1 - hash value
- Please avoid dropping large files here, particularly so if they're non-ascii. For large files that are available elsewhere, provide a link that can be used to download the file. This applies, for instance, to large pics, movies, etc.
- When adding data, scripts, assets, models, etc., please take the long view. SBEL and the public at large will likely try to use this information for years to come.
