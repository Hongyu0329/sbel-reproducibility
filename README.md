# publications-data
Repo contains Chrono models, data, assets, scripts, etc., needed to generate results we publish in papers, tech reports, proposals, etc.

This repo contains data organized by year of when the manuscript was generated.

Each time we finish a manuscript that is public, the models, data, assets, scripts, etc. that were used to generate the manuscript should be deposited here for folks from outside the lab to be able to reproduce our results.

In an ideal world, for a manuscript, we would only provide a git commit ID for Chrono, a git commit ID for a Chrono model in chrono_project repo, etc. This info would be dropped in a readme.md/txt file, with possible links to Box in case we have movies, pics, etc. that are tied to the manuscript.
However, if providing a commit ID is not applicable and/or more code, data, assets, scripts, etc., are needed - this is where these additional things should be dropped.

When you add data, scripts, assets, models, etc., please take the long view. We at SBEL might have to actually use this information without you being around - you might have graduated by the time we get the manuscript published.
