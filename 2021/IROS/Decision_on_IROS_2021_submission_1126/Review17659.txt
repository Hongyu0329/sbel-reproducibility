======================

Project Chrono seems a very promising simulator for
learning of off-road vehicles. It is an interesting paper,
but there are some doubts that could be addressed:

1) From reading the paper, it is not clear that modeling
the ground is important for learning the policies. It would
be important to show that modeling the ground using a
heightfield (as is common in other simulators) is not
sufficient.

2) Other physics engines, such as MuJoCo and certainly
PyBullet can simulate vehicles.  I've seen running models
of a Husky and racecar with Ackerman steering, LIDAR and
cameras in PyBullet RL environments. Those engines can
model unstructured terrain with heightfields and irregular
triangle meshes, with some degree of soft contact.

3) it would be important to show that the policy transfers
from simulation to the real world, and show that training a
policy in a regular rigid body simulator (MuJoCo, PyBullet,
Gazebo) doesn't tranfer as well.
