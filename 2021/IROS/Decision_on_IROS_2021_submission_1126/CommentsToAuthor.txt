=====================================

The paper presents an end-to-end strategy to learn the
policy for the navigation in complex off-road scenarios; to
this purpose, it is used the so-called Chrono simulator.

The work is considered interesting and the presented
simulator relevant for the considered application.

However, the main concerns regard the novelty and
contribution of the work. The presented simulator could be
better claimed with respect to the other existing
simulators and what is already presented in other
publications. The learning architecture could be further
described and evaluated.

For the details, please refer to the comments provided by
